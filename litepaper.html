          </h1>
          <br>
          <p class="text-start text-gray-400 items-center inline-block w-25 text-base sm:text-base text-md md:text-lg">Pony Shiba Inu offers a unique approach to investing in cryptocurrency that prioritizes the interests of investors and the community. The Pony Shiba Horde, or the community of Pony Shiba Inu investors, plays a central role in the success of the project. This is achieved through the use of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that gives the community control over key decision-making processes and increased transparency.

            A significant difference between Pony Shiba Inu and other crypto projects is the allocation of the total money supply. While many cryptocurrencies benefit the founders exclusively, Pony Shiba Inu aims to minimize the risk of trading altcoins and promote long-term portfolio growth by allocating only a minimal portion of the money supply to the team. This approach empowers the community to make crucial decisions and steer the project in the desired direction.
            
            The Pony Shiba Treasury is another innovative aspect of Pony Shiba Inu that sets it apart from other crypto projects. Instead of charging investors to trade and buy the cryptocurrency, a small portion of each trade (3% BUY / 3% SELL) goes towards the liquidity pool and an equal portion enters the Pony Shiba Treasury. The Pony Shiba Treasury, controlled by a Gnosis Safe wallet, will increase in value through various sources such as NFT royalties and commercial merchandise sales. This fund will be shared amongst investors monthly, providing another source of income for those who hold the token for an extended period.
            
            The Pony Shiba Horde is the community of Pony Shiba Inu investors who believe in the vision and mission of the project. This group of like-minded individuals work together to achieve their investment goals and promote the growth and success of the project. The Pony Shiba Horde represents the power of the community in driving the success of the project and ensuring its longevity.
            
            In conclusion, Pony Shiba Inu offers a unique and innovative approach to investing in cryptocurrency that prioritizes the interests of investors and the community. With its focus on minimizing risk, promoting long-term growth, and empowering the community through a DAO, Pony Shiba Inu is poised for success and poised to challenge the status quo of the traditional crypto landscape.</p>

              <p class="text-start text-gray-400 items-center inline-block w-25 text-base sm:text-base text-md md:text-lg">The future of the Pony Shiba Inu token lies in the hands of its community. To empower token holders and give them a voice, Pony Shiba Inu is investing in a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to drive community growth and development. This means that all decisions about the direction of the project will be made collaboratively by the community, making Pony Shiba Inu truly a token for the people, by the people.

                In addition to the DAO, Pony Shiba Inu also has plans to launch a stablecoin in the future. Backed by the Pony Shiba Inu token, this stablecoin will provide even more stability and security to investors, making it an attractive option for those looking to diversify their portfolio. The details of this exciting development will be shared at a later date, so stay tuned!
                
                Pony Shiba Inu is more than just a token, it’s a movement. The Pony Shiba Horde, as we like to call our community, is made up of individuals who believe in the power of community-driven crypto projects. By banding together, we’re building a strong and united front that is dedicated to shaping the future of crypto for the better. Join the horde and be a part of the change!</p>

                  The Pony Shiba Quest is an ecosystem built with three powerful WEB3 tools: Pony Quest, Quest3, and Crew3. We’re using Crew3 to manage the tasks between every quest, from the primary quest with Pony Quest to the secondary quest with Quest3. By submitting your daily tasks, you’ll grow and climb the leaderboard over time, earning rewards and exclusive awards for being in the top rank. You don’t need to hold $Pony Shiba or be online 24/7 to climb the ladder; consistency is critical.
                  
                  Pony Shiba Inu Crew3 is our quest management and verification process.
                  
                  Our primary quest is with Pony Shiba Inu Pony Quest, where you must select your roles in Discord based on your skills and interests. We’ll manually review each application before allowing you to use/work for the Pony Shiba Inu ecosystem. You’ll be paid in Pony Shiba or BNB for your work.
                  
                  Our secondary quest is with Pony Shiba Inu Quest3, an incredible tool that allows us to compound our community and grow our social media. The simple quests include tweeting, retweeting, commenting on Reddit, posting memes, and holding specific NFTs. You’ll gain experience and rewards, but Quest3 is luck-based, and only a few will be chosen with a lucky draw.
                  
                  Join us today and be part of the Pony Shiba Inu community, where you can earn rewards for your contributions while helping build a thriving and sustainable ecosystem.</p>
